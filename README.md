1. I have removed all data from table.
2. We can add validator to api for robust system. I didn't find any instruction to add so I skipped.

 I have deployed this instance to free tier renderer server. It will stop the instance incase of inactivity for some time. If you are facing any issue while calling the api, please let me know I will restart the instance.
